Oracle Live is a web-based tool that allows you to write and execute SQL queries against an Oracle database. It does not support all of the commands in the image you sent, but it does support the following:

SQL
SELECT column
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column ASC|DESC


You can use these commands to perform the following tasks:

SQL
SELECT department_id, MAX(salary), MIN(salary), SUM(salary) AS total_salary, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY average_salary DESC


Display the maximum salary, minimum salary, sum of salaries, and average salary of each job title:

SQL
SELECT job_id, MAX(salary), MIN(salary), SUM(salary) AS total_salary, AVG(salary) AS average_salary

ORDER BY average_salary DESC

FROM (
  SELECT employee_id
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY employee_id

)


Display the total number of department IDs (including and excluding null values):

FROM employees


Display the total number of distinct department IDs (including and excluding null values):

       MAX(hire_date) AS last_employee_hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE job_id = 'SA REP'

Display the number of employees who have left their jobs, grouped by the year they left and their job ID, ordered by the number of employees in each group in decreasing order, followed by the year they left in increasing order:

SQL
SELECT termination_year, job_id, COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees
FROM employees
WHERE termination_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY termination_year, job_id
ORDER BY number_of_employees DESC, termination_year ASC


Display the average salary and number of employees for each job ID, excluding job IDs with an average salary less than or equal to 10000 and a number of employees equal to 1, ordered by average salary in ascending order:
